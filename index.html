            I'm a 4th-year Computer Science student at York University,
            expecting to graduate in August 2025. Over the past few years, I‚Äôve
            developed a solid foundation in full-stack development, backend
            systems, and embedded systems. I‚Äôm especially passionate about
            designing and building modern, scalable web applications that
            deliver meaningful user experiences. My technical interests extend
            to areas like e-commerce platforms, data visualization, and systems
            design‚Äîwhere I enjoy applying creative and practical solutions to
            real-world problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of academics, I run my own e-commerce company where I sell
            Beyblades‚Äîa niche I‚Äôve grown into a thriving brand. I built the
            website from the ground up, handling everything from UI design to
            payment integration and fulfillment logistics. Through this venture,
            I‚Äôve gained hands-on experience with web development, SEO,
            analytics, customer support, and digital marketing. It‚Äôs been an
            exciting challenge that not only strengthened my technical skillset,
            but also taught me a lot about business, branding, and the
            importance of user-centric design.

            In my spare time, I'm usually coding üßë‚Äçüíª, gaming üéÆ, planning future

                  A web app that visualizes pathfinding on real city graphs with

                  backend is a Python/Flask API that computes Dijkstra, A*, BFS,
                  DFS, and bidirectional search, returning a compact JSON
                  payload with the path and visit order. The frontend uses HTML5
                  Canvas with offscreen caching, precomputed node positions, and
                  requestAnimationFrame to render neon-style glows and fast
                  interactions on large maps. Performance is optimized with
                  path‚Äëonly responses, gzip via Flask‚ÄëCompress, and a stateless
                  design suited for serverless deployment on Vercel.

                  (ALU) and a Control Unit to process and manage data
                  operations. The system also integrates eight 8-bit registers,
                  a finite state machine (FSM), and a 3x8 decoder to handle
                  instruction processing. Additionally, user interaction is
                  facilitated by a seven-segment display.

                  microcontroller (MCU), utilizing peripherals such as a keypad,
                  7-segment display, and an LCD to interact with Morse code
                  input and output. The core functionality is the translation of
                  user input, specifically the letter ‚ÄúA‚Äù on the keypad, into
                  its corresponding Morse code sequence. The project includes
                  both hardware-level and software-level features, with
                  real-time interrupts (RTI) and key debounce mechanisms for
                  smooth operation.

            Jun 2025 ‚Äì Present<br />
            As a volunteer Mobile Developer at Masjid Siratul Mustaqim, I helped
            towards raising $3M for a new mosque by building a modular Flutter
            app that offers a rich suite of Islamic features including Quran,
            Hadith, Duas, and location-aware prayer times. I implemented a
            GPT-4-powered Islamic Q&A chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented
            Generation (RAG), combining Firestore data with OpenAI via a custom
            FastAPI/Node.js backend. To improve search accuracy, I integrated
